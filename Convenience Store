// Given a total due and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether or not you are able to pay for the item. 
// Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
// To illustrate: changeEnough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50.

// quarter: 25 cents / $0.25
